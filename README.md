# sillyquip

Sillyquip is a doge-themed ransomware which holds your files hostage in exchange for doge memes.

### How does it work?

When you run Sillyquip, it generates a 32-character key. This is then sent to me along with a randomly generated ID number. The key is then used to automatically encrypt all files in your Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Pictures, Music, and Videos directories to make them useless, but recoverable. A contact email is provided using the random ID number. You must send a fresh doge meme to the contact email, and if it is to doge's liking, I will send back the key corresponding to your ID. This key, when entered, will unlock all your files and your system will be freed from the clutches of doge.

Since this is educational, I have also provided an executable which tells you your key, so you don't have to go through with the email process. This key can be copied and entered into the main ransomware to unlock the system. (The ransomware saves the key somewhere on your PC, and that's why this works.)

### DISCLAIMER

This tool is a proof of concept, created for **educational purposes only**. I am not responsible for data loss due to this tool. There is no guarantee that the key will generate properly, and there is always the chance of your files getting lost forever. If you do run this tool, and go through with the steps of making a doge meme, I will happily accept your meme and send your unlock key. However, no promises that I will do this forever, so, there's always the unlocker tool.
